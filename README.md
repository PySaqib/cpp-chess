# C++ Chess by Saqib Ali

### Context

I was assigned a final project to create a Chess game in C++. The basic problem statement included a board, along with piece validations, 
and special moves. I tried to get as many things incorporated as possible.

### What's next?
In my holidays, I will try to create it again in Python or maybe in C++ using OOP. <br>
I also want to incoporate some GUI in the future so hopefully it'll all be very exciting.

That's the end of the project. I got a 4.00 in this course and everything ended on a positive note.
